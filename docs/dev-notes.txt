REFLECTIONS
-----------

Reflection (2025-06-05, statistics panel bugfix):
Fixed the statistics panel so all tracked stats (coins earned, clicks, upgrades, auto-collectors, time played) update and persist correctly. The issue was due to event handler wrapping order and missing direct stat updates in the main action handlers. Now, all main actions update stats directly, ensuring robust and future-proof tracking. This makes the stats panel a reliable and satisfying QOL feature for players who want to see their progress!

Reflection (2025-06-05, UX overhaul & visual feedback):
Major UX overhaul: improved layout, button styles, and added visual feedback for all main actions.
Collecting coins now animates the button and shows a coin fly effect; upgrades and auto-collector
purchases animate their buttons. The UI feels more modern, responsive, and satisfying to interact
with. This is a big step toward a polished, delightful incremental game experience.

Reflection (2025-06-05, tooltips):
Added info icons and tooltips for upgrades, shop items, and achievements. This makes the game much
more user-friendly and self-explanatory, especially for new players. The tooltips are accessible
and styled to fit the UI, and the info icons are keyboard-focusable for accessibility. This is a
big QOL win for clarity and polish.

Reflection (2025-06-05, auto-save indicator):
Adding the auto-save indicator and manual save button felt like a solid QOL improvement. It’s
satisfying to see the game become more user-friendly and transparent, and I think these small
touches really help make the experience feel more polished and trustworthy for players. Looking
forward to adding more polish and features!

Reflection (2025-06-05, hotkeys):
Adding hotkeys for common actions (C = collect, U = upgrade, A = auto-collector, S = save) makes
the game feel much snappier and more accessible, especially for keyboard users. It’s a small but
meaningful boost to usability and accessibility. I’m happy with how quickly this improved the play
experience!

Reflection (2025-06-05, button auto-repeat fix):
Fixed an issue where holding down the "Collect Coin" and "Save Now" buttons would trigger
multiple actions due to auto-repeat. Now, both buttons only trigger their action once per press,
regardless of how long they are held down. This makes the game feel more responsive and prevents
accidental rapid progress or save spamming. The solution uses a simple pressed-state flag and works
for both mouse and keyboard input. This is a subtle but important QOL improvement for a polished
incremental game experience.
